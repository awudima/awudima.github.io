title: The Granule Project
---

The Granule project is an ambitious research project whose goal is to
rethink the foundations of statically-typed functional programming
languages by making resource sensitivity an integral aspect of the
language design.  Our work strives to show that by combining a linear
type system with fine-grained (co)effects via graded modal types one
obtains a very powerful programming language capable of precisely
enforcing resource usage throughout the language.

We are actively developing a prototype implementation called
[Granule](/granule.html) based on our research.  In addition, we are
developing a new [dependent type theory]() that will greatly expand
the expressive power of Granule's type system.  For more information
about our current research directions please read this series of [blog
posts]().
